# ImageSharp.Xamarin.Benchmarks
ImageSharp benchmarks ported to run with Xamarin.Forms.

The benchmarks have been adapted from the [ImageSharp Benchmarks](https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp/tree/master/tests/ImageSharp.Benchmarks) which were adapted from the [PhotoSauce's MemoryStress project](https://github.com/saucecontrol/core-imaging-playground/tree/beeees/MemoryStress).  

### Setup
